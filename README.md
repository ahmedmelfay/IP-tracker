## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Redux](https://nextjs.org/) - JS library for state management
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - JS library for fetching data from an API

### What I learned

I finally got the hang of redux and learnt how to use it to manage complext states in my app.

### Continued development

- Design Improvement
  Although this design is from frontendmento.io, i'd still like to improve it, and maybe add different themes option.

- Different search options
  Its a WIP feature where user can search by domain name instead of IP Address
